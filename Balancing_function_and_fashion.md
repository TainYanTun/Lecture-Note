Balancing function and fashion refers to striking a balance between practicality and usefulness (function) 
and aesthetic appeal (fashion) while developing or selecting clothing, accessories, or other things.

Function: 
This element considers the item's practicality and utility. Clothing factors include comfort, durability, weather appropriateness, and suitability for the intended activity or purpose. 
For example, a winter coat must be both warm and waterproof to work well.

Fashion:
It refers to the aesthetic features of an item, such as its design, style, color, and general appeal.
It is about how the thing seems and how the wearer feels.

In conclusion, striking a balance between function and fashion ensures that the object not only appears excellent but also fulfills its intended purpose successfully, resulting in both style and practicality
